It's Coding Time!
=================

An Alfred workflow for quickly launching all my coding applications in OS X. To launch, just open Alfred and start typing _coding time_.

This work flow currently opens the following applications:

* Atom
* Codebox
* Dropbox folder where code is kept
* Github
* MAMP
* Slack
* SourceTree

To change these applications, simply open up Alfred's preferences -> Workflows -> Coding Time! -> Launch Apps / Files

Enjoy!
